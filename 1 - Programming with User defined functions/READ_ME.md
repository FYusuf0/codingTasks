# Holiday Cost Calculator

## Description
The Holiday Cost Calculator is a Python program that was designed to help users to estimate the total cost of their holiday. It works by taking inputs from the user about the city they want to go to, the number of nights they plan on staying and how many days they plan on renting a car. This is all taken and the program calculates the total cost of the holiday. 

This coding task is important for introducing how to use functions, conditionals and user inputs. All of these aspects are fundamental in the world of programming.
