# Titanic EDA

## Description
For this project, it involves creating an in-depth Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Jupyter Notebook. The analysis aims to uncover insights and possible patterns that are related to the passenger survival rate. The EDA will answer specific guiding questions and includes the appropriate visualisations needed to support my findings. 

Learning EDA is crucial for data scientists and analysts as it is used to help gain a better understanding of the data, identify patterns and make informed decisions based on the findings.

## Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following software installed:

Python (3.x)
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas library
* seaborn library
* matplotlib library

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:
- *Jupyter Notebook* -- pip install notebook 
- *Pandas* -- pip install pandas
- *seaborn* -- pip install seaborn
- *matplotlib* -- pip install matplotlib

## Usage
Open the 'titanic.ipynb' notebook and follow the analysis. The notebook answers the following guiding questions with appropriate visualizations:

### Guiding Questions
1. What is the most important factor in determining survival of the Titanic incident?

2. In the movie, the upper-class passengers were given preference on lifeboats. Does this show in the data?

3. "Women and children first". Was this the case?

4. Add one other observation that you have noted in the dataset.
