# Dataset Analysis and Reporting

## Description
This project consists of two main tasks, these tasks required me to analyse and report data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The first task involves selecting data and sorting it using pandas DataFrame operations. The second task focuses on generating a detailed report from the dataset. 

Learning these concepts of data manipulation and analysis is critical for data science and analytical roles.
