# Dataset Analysis and Reporting

## Description
This project consists of two main tasks, these tasks required me to analyse and report data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The first task involves selecting data and sorting it using pandas DataFrame operations. The second task focuses on generating a detailed report from the dataset. 

Learning these concepts of data manipulation and analysis is critical for data science and analytical roles.

## Installation
To run this project locally, make sure you have the following software installed on your m machine:
* Python (version 3.X)
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas library

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:
- *Jupyter Notebook* -- pip install notebook 
- *Pandas* -- pip install pandas

## Usage

### Task 1
Open the 'Datasets Task.ipynb' file and complete the following steps:
1. Data Selection and Sorting
* Select the 'Limit' and 'Rating' columns of the first five observations
* Select the first five observations with 4 cards
* Sort the observations by 'Education'. Show users with a high education value first

2. Explanation of Code
* df.iloc[:, :]
* df.iloc[5:, 5:]
* df.iloc[:, 0]
* df.iloc[9, :]

### Task 2
Open the 'report.ipynb' file and perform the following analysis:
1. Create a DataFrame from 'balance.txt'

2. Produce the Report
* Compare the average income based on ethnicity
* On average, do married or single people have a higher balance?
* What is the highest income in our dataset?
* What is the lowest income in our dataset?
* How many cards do we have recorded in our dataset?
* How many females do we have information for vs how many males?
