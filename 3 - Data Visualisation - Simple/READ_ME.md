# Data Visualisation Task

## Description
This project involves the generation of various graphs from the dataset 'Cars93.csv' and analysing the visualisations. The creation of these different types of plots, such as box plots, histograms, line plots, and bar plots, demonstrates how important  data visualisation is for understanding and interpreting patterns in data and their relationships.

## Usage

### Box Plot for Revs per Mile
1. Generate a box plot for the revs per mile for the Audi, Hyundai, Suzuki, and Toyota car manufacturers.

2. Question: Which of these manufacturers has the car with the highest revs per mile?

### Histogram of MPG
1. Generate a histogram of MPG in the city and MPG on the highway on the same axis.

2. Question: Is it generally more fuel-efficient to drive in the city or on the highway?

### Line Plot for Wheelbase and Turning Circle
1. Generate a line plot showing the relationship between the 'Wheelbase' and 'Turning circle'.

2. Questions:
* What is the relationship between the 'Wheelbase' and 'Turning circle'?

* What happens when the Wheelbase gets larger?

* Answer these questions in markdown cells in the notebook.

### Bar Plot for Mean Horsepower
1. Generate a bar plot showing the mean horsepower for each car Type (Small, Midsize, etc.).

2. Question: Does a larger car mean more horsepower?
